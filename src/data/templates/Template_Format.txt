DESCRIPTION OF TEMPLATE FORMAT

Primary HDU (HDU 0) contains comments with basic information about the templates: 

SIMPLE  =                    T / conforms to FITS standard                      
BITPIX  =                    8 / array data type                                
NAXIS   =                    0 / number of array dimensions                     
EXTEND  =                    T                                                  
COMMENT Photometry from 28 objects                                              
COMMENT Template made from 31 Co-added individual BOSS (SDSS) spectra           
COMMENT All added templated had 0.0 > FeH > -0.5dex      

First table extension (HDU 1) contains the spectrum information: 

XTENSION= 'BINTABLE'           / binary table extension                         
BITPIX  =                    8 / array data type

NAXIS1  =                   12 / length of dimension 1                          
NAXIS2  =                61618 / length of dimension 2                          
PCOUNT  =                    0 / number of group parameters

where the first field, LogLam contains the wavelength grid in log spacing, the second field contains the corresponding co-added flux grid, and the third field contains the propagated error reported by BOSS for each spectrum co-added. 

Second table extension (HDU 2) contains properties of the templates (color information, effective temperature, surface gravity when applicable): 

XTENSION= 'BINTABLE'           / binary table extension

Each of these properties contains an array with 3 entries. The first is the average value of the property (i.e. average u-g color for all co-added spectra), the second is the propagated error in the photometry reported by BOSS, and the third is the standard deviation of all the values averaged together.
